    This webapp based project revolves around CEE's "Mari Shaala" initiative, whose  main goals were to ensure that children in rural areas get admitted in schools,continue going to the school on a regular basis,ensure that children have a positive environment in  their respective schools and get quality education.We,the second year DAIICT students,as a part of our Internship programme with CEE,created this webapp to keep tab on the attendance of the Teacher Mentors,Specialist Teachers and Locam teachers under the 'Mari Shaala' project.The Specialist teachers and the Locam Teachers can  signup,login and submit the leave form with ease.And also the Coordinator and the Teacher Mentors thus,will get to know very easily and in a very organised and concise manner,about the teachers on leave.There are also many added features like Probation status,Resignation Details,Searching a particular employee,editing one's personal details,special Admin rights and so on. The main aim of the project was to lessen the manpower and paperwork that was formerly in practice,so as to facilitate CEE in increasing the productivity of the project.
